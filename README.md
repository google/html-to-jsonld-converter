# HTML to JSON-LD Converter

Note: This project is for demonstration only and is not an officially supported Google product. 

## Introduction
This tool is a sample reference code (proof-of-concept) for how to write HTML to JSON-LD format converter in python. Using this, merchant partners (with no or low tech teams) can take legacy html product descriptions and generate JSON-LD format data to potentially hand validate, and then upload to Google commerce systems. It simply does a translation of supported html tags into json-ld tags. Partners will be expected to fork this sample reference code and enhance it for their needs.
